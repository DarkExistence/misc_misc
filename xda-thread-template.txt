[B][SIZE="4"]About LD[/SIZE][/B]
Years after the death of LiquidSmooth, Sean Hoyt, (the LiquidSmooth lead dev) has returned to the ROM game, along with the Exynos5420 team, to bring greatness to our beloved Exynos5420 tablets (and note 3), out of the ashes of the fallen LiquidSmooth ROM. LiquidDeathOS is super optimized for the Exynos5420. 
In fact right now it is so optimized that it won't even boot on non-exynos devices :) 
LDO is AOSP based , and is only for Exynos devices 
(it's even more optimized than cm).
